# Plant Leaf Detection - Android App

## Aim

This is an android application in which we can click picture of any plant leaf and this app will detect which plant it is. This helps people who doesn't have much knowledge in crops and still want to dive deep. Further, this app can be modified to get physical condition of plant like if its healthy or got some type of disease. 

Machine learning model is trained already and deployed on Firbase ML service. This app contains integration of app to Firebase ML service. 

Note: Currently only one plant is deployed (`corn`), In future other plants are to be added.

## Technolgies Used

- `Java` for creating Android based Native Mobile App.
- `Machine learning` for predicting plant type.
